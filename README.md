#Service Loader

Sample application to play around with java.util.ServiceLoader class.
The application uses it to load different implementation at runtime.

```
    app1        - Sample application
    service-api - Set of services
    platform-a  - Implementation 1
    platform-b  - Implementation 2
```

run-platform-a.sh and run-platform-b.sh run the sample application
using implementation 1 and implementation 2 respectively.
